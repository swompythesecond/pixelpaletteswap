                <p>Color palette swapping is one of the most powerful techniques in pixel art. Whether you want to
                    create alternate character skins, design enemy variants, or simply experiment with different color
                    schemes, palette swapping lets you transform your artwork without redrawing a single pixel.</p>

                <p>In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn exactly how to swap colors in pixel art using
                    PixelPaletteSwap, from uploading your first image to exporting your finished creation.</p>

                <h2>What Is Palette Swapping?</h2>

                <p>Palette swapping is the process of replacing one or more colors in an image with different colors
                    while keeping everything else—shapes, outlines, shading—exactly the same. It's a technique that
                    dates back to the earliest days of video games, when hardware limitations forced developers to be
                    creative with limited color palettes.</p>

                <p>Classic games like Super Mario Bros. used palette swapping extensively. The Koopa Troopas, for
                    example, came in green and red variants that were identical sprites with swapped colors. This
                    allowed developers to create visual variety without using extra memory for additional graphics.</p>

                <p>Today, palette swapping remains popular because it's incredibly efficient. Instead of drawing new art
                    for every character variant, you create one base design and generate unlimited color variations from
                    it.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Prepare Your Pixel Art</h2>

                <p>Before you start swapping colors, make sure your pixel art is ready:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use clean, distinct colors:</strong> Palette swapping works best when your art uses a
                        limited number of clearly defined colors. If your sprite has 100 shades of brown, swapping will
                        be tedious.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid anti-aliasing:</strong> Smooth edges that blend into the background can create
                        dozens of extra colors that complicate swapping. Stick to hard edges for best results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep your original safe:</strong> Always keep a backup of your original artwork. While
                        you can reset changes in the tool, having a separate backup is always wise.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <div class="tip-box-title">💡 Pro Tip</div>
                    <p>The best candidates for palette swapping are sprites with 4-16 colors. This is enough for detail
                        and shading while keeping the color selection manageable.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Step 2: Upload Your Image</h2>

                <p>Getting started is simple. Navigate to the <a href="../index.html">PixelPaletteSwap tool</a> and
                    upload your artwork in one of the following ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Click the upload area</strong> to open a file browser and select your image</li>
                    <li><strong>Drag and drop</strong> your file directly onto the upload zone</li>
                    <li><strong>Upload multiple files</strong> to treat them as animation frames</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The tool supports GIF, PNG, JPG, and WebP formats. If you upload a GIF, all frames will be loaded
                    automatically, and you can see the animation play in real-time.</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Understand the Interface</h2>

                <p>Once your image is loaded, you'll see several key areas:</p>

                <h3>The Preview Canvas</h3>
                <p>This shows your pixel art with a checkerboard background (indicating transparency). Use the zoom
                    slider to make small sprites easier to work with—pixel art often benefits from being viewed at 4x to
                    8x magnification.</p>

                <h3>The Color Palette</h3>
                <p>On the right side, you'll see every unique color in your image displayed as a grid of colored
                    squares. The number in the header tells you how many colors were detected. Click any color to select
                    it for swapping.</p>

                <h3>The Swap Controls</h3>
                <p>Below the palette, you'll find the color swap interface. Here you can see the original color you've
                    selected and choose a new color to replace it with.</p>

                <h3>Animation Controls</h3>
                <p>For animated GIFs or image sequences, use the play/pause button and frame navigation to review your
                    animation. The FPS slider lets you adjust playback speed.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Select a Color to Replace</h2>

                <p>There are two ways to select a color for swapping:</p>

                <h3>Method 1: Click the Palette</h3>
                <p>In the color palette grid, click on any color square. It will become highlighted, and the "Original
                    Color" preview will update to show your selection.</p>

                <h3>Method 2: Click the Image</h3>
                <p>Click directly on your pixel art in the preview canvas. The tool will pick up whatever color is under
                    your cursor. This is especially useful when you're not sure which palette color corresponds to a
                    specific part of your sprite.</p>

                <h2>Step 5: Choose a New Color</h2>

                <p>With your original color selected, choose what you want to replace it with:</p>

                <h3>Using the Color Picker</h3>
                <p>Click the color picker box (labeled "New Color") to open your browser's color selection dialog. You
                    can pick any color from the spectrum, enter a specific hex code, or use the eyedropper to sample
                    from anywhere on your screen.</p>

                <h3>Using an Existing Palette</h3>
                <p>If you want to match colors from another piece of pixel art, use the "Import Palette from Image"
                    feature. Upload a reference image, and you can click any color from that image to use it as your
                    swap target.</p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <div class="tip-box-title">💡 Pro Tip</div>
                    <p>Many pixel artists use established palettes like PICO-8 or Endesga-32. You can download these
                        palette images and import them as a reference to ensure color consistency across your work.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Step 6: Apply the Swap</h2>

                <p>Click the "Apply Color Swap" button. Instantly, every pixel of the original color will change to your
                    new color—across all frames if you're working with an animation.</p>

                <p>The change is immediately visible in the preview. If you're working with an animated GIF, you can
                    play the animation to see how the new color looks in motion.</p>

                <h2>Step 7: Repeat for Other Colors</h2>

                <p>Most palette swaps involve changing multiple colors. For example, converting a green character to red
                    might require swapping:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Light green → Light red</li>
                    <li>Medium green → Medium red</li>
                    <li>Dark green → Dark red</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Simply repeat steps 4-6 for each color you want to change. The tool tracks all your swaps, so you can
                    see a history of the changes you've made.</p>

                <h2>Step 8: Export Your Result</h2>

                <p>When you're happy with your palette swap, it's time to export:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Export Frame:</strong> Save the currently visible frame as a PNG file</li>
                    <li><strong>Export All PNGs:</strong> Download all frames as separate PNG files in a ZIP archive
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>For animated sprites destined for game engines, the PNG sequence export is often preferred since it
                    gives you control over individual frames.</p>

                <h2>Advanced: Using Selection Tools</h2>

                <p>Sometimes you don't want to swap a color everywhere—just in a specific area. The selection tools let
                    you define exactly where color swaps should apply:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rectangle Selection:</strong> Click and drag to create a rectangular selection area</li>
                    <li><strong>Polygon Selection:</strong> Click to add points and create a custom shape. Double-click
                        or press Enter to complete the selection</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With a selection active, color swaps only affect pixels within the selected area. You can also invert
                    the selection to swap colors everywhere except the selected region.</p>

                <h2>Advanced: Saving Presets</h2>

                <p>If you've created a palette swap you want to use again—for example, a "red team" variant that you'll
                    apply to multiple character sprites—you can save it as a preset:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Make all your color swaps</li>
                    <li>Click "Export" in the Color Swap Presets section</li>
                    <li>Save the JSON file</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Later, when editing a different sprite with matching original colors, you can "Import" that preset to
                    instantly apply the same color mappings.</p>

                <h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>

                <h3>"Too Many Colors Detected"</h3>
                <p>If your image shows hundreds of colors when you expected only a few, it likely contains
                    anti-aliasing, gradients, or compression artifacts. Try working with a cleaner source image, or be
                    prepared to swap many similar colors individually.</p>

                <h3>"Color Swap Looks Wrong"</h3>
                <p>Make sure you're swapping all shades of a color, not just one. If you swap dark green to dark red but
                    leave light green unchanged, the result will look inconsistent.</p>

                <h3>"Can't Find a Color"</h3>
                <p>Use the eyedropper by clicking directly on the preview canvas. This picks up the exact color of that
                    pixel, which you can then swap.</p>
