                <p>Even experienced pixel artists make palette mistakes. Learning to identify and fix these issues will
                    dramatically improve your artwork. Here are the most common problems and their solutions.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #1: Insufficient Value Contrast</h2>
                <p>The most common beginner mistake is choosing colors that look different in hue but have similar
                    brightness (value). A red and green might seem distinct, but if they're the same brightness, your
                    artwork will look muddy and unclear.</p>

                <h3>How to Identify It</h3>
                <p>Convert your artwork to grayscale. If different elements blend together and become indistinguishable,
                    you have a value contrast problem.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>For every color used for shading or depth, ensure there's a clear value difference. Shadows should be
                    noticeably darker, highlights noticeably lighter. Use PixelPaletteSwap to adjust specific colors to
                    brighter or darker variants while keeping the hue.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #2: Too Many Similar Colors</h2>
                <p>Having five slightly different shades of blue when two would suffice wastes palette space and makes
                    your art harder to manage. This often happens when using the eyedropper to sample colors from
                    photos.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>Consolidate similar colors. In PixelPaletteSwap, swap all those similar blues to a single chosen
                    blue. You'll be surprised how often this simplification actually improves the artwork by creating
                    cleaner shapes.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #3: Pure Black Outlines</h2>
                <p>Using #000000 pure black for all outlines creates harsh, unnatural-looking pixel art. It can make
                    colors appear washed out by comparison and creates a "coloring book" feel.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>Use colored outlines instead. Dark blue for cool-toned subjects, dark brown for warm-toned subjects.
                    Or use a very dark version of the object's main color. This technique is called "selective
                    outlining" and creates much more sophisticated artwork.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #4: Random Saturation Levels</h2>
                <p>Mixing highly saturated colors with very desaturated ones without purpose creates visual discord.
                    Your bright neon character looks out of place against muted background colors.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>Establish a saturation range for your project and stick to it. If your backgrounds are muted, keep
                    characters slightly more saturated to pop, but not absurdly so. Use PixelPaletteSwap to adjust
                    colors toward consistent saturation levels.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #5: No Hue Shifting</h2>
                <p>Making shadows by simply darkening a color, or highlights by simply brightening it, creates flat,
                    lifeless artwork. Real light doesn't work this way—shadows typically shift cool and highlights shift
                    warm.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>When creating shading ramps, shift hue as you shift value. A green leaf's shadow might shift toward
                    blue-green, while its highlight shifts toward yellow-green. This creates vibrant, living colors
                    rather than muddy darkness.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #6: Ignoring Color Temperature</h2>
                <p>Mixing warm and cool colors without considering how they interact can create visual confusion. A
                    character with warm skin, cool clothes, and neutral accessories looks incoherent.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>Establish a dominant temperature for your artwork. If it's a sunny beach scene, lean warm overall. If
                    it's a snowy mountain, lean cool. Accent with the opposite temperature strategically—a warm campfire
                    in a cold scene, for example.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #7: Colors That Don't Exist in Your Palette</h2>
                <p>This usually happens with anti-aliasing or when importing photos. You think you have 16 colors, but
                    actually have 200 because of in-between shades at edges.</p>

                <h3>How to Identify It</h3>
                <p>PixelPaletteSwap shows your total color count when you upload an image. If it's much higher than
                    expected, you have extra colors.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>Either work with intentionally clean pixel art from the start, or use PixelPaletteSwap to manually
                    consolidate those extra colors into your intended palette.</p>

                <h2>Mistake #8: Using Colors That Clash</h2>
                <p>Certain color combinations vibrate unpleasantly when placed next to each other—like saturated red
                    against saturated cyan. They literally hurt to look at.</p>

                <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
                <p>Either desaturate one of the clashing colors, add a neutral buffer between them, or swap one to a
                    more harmonious hue. Study established palettes like PICO-8 to see how they avoid these clashes.</p>

                <h2>Prevention: Use Established Palettes</h2>
                <p>The easiest way to avoid most palette mistakes is to start with a curated palette like PICO-8,
                    Endesga 32, or DawnBringer 16. These palettes are designed to work harmoniously, with proper value
                    ranges and hue shifting built in.</p>

                    <div class="tip-box-title">💡 Pro Tip</div>
                    <p>When in doubt, reduce your palette. Fewer colors forces you to use each one more thoughtfully,
                        often resulting in cleaner, more intentional artwork.</p>
